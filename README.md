## 7. Correlation Between Revenue & Price
![](IMA/Screenshot%202025-05-15%20125946.png)
The data points (Men's Apparel, Men's Athletic Footwear, Men's Street Footwear, Women's Apparel, Women's Athletic Footwear, Women's Street Footwear) show a scattered distribution without a clear linear trend.  
There is no consistent upward or downward pattern. Men's Street Footwear has the highest sales ($1.99M) at $43.78, while Women's Apparel has moderate sales ($1.7M) at a higher price ($51.13), and Women's Street Footwear has low sales ($1.02M) at $40.65. 

## 8. Sales Performance Analysis by Region and Product Category
![](IMA/Screenshot%202025-05-15%20130019.png)
1. Top-Performing Product Categories: Men’s Street Footwear recorded the highest sales overall, with the Northeast region leading at $510K, followed by the West at $460K. This category stands out as the strongest revenue driver and suggests high national demand. Women’s Apparel also performed consistently well across all regions, especially in the West ($452K) and Northeast ($375K). This indicates sustained interest and a reliable revenue stream in this segment.  
2. Strong Regional Contributions: The West region emerged as the strongest overall performer, leading in five out of six product categories. This consistent dominance suggests a mature and receptive market, making it ideal for new product launches or premium offerings. The Northeast demonstrated strong performance in categories such as Men’s Street Footwear and Women’s Apparel, indicating consumer preference for urban/stylish products.  
3. Underperforming Categories: Women’s Athletic Footwear showed the lowest sales across most regions, with particularly weak performance in the Midwest ($135K) and South ($184K). Despite moderate interest in the West ($302K), this category represents a potential growth area if repositioned with better marketing and product variety. Women’s Street Footwear had mixed results, strong in the West ($369K) but underperforming in other regions like the Midwest ($162K). This suggests regional variation in fashion preferences or seasonal relevance.  
4. Low-Performing Regions: The Midwest and South generally recorded the lowest sales across most product categories. Their consistent underperformance suggests potential issues such as limited market penetration, distribution challenges, or misaligned product offerings.

## 9. Sales Channel Analysis
![](IMA/Screenshot%202025-05-15%20130039.png)
• In-store sales generated the highest revenue, totaling $3.57M, positioning it as the top-performing channel. Despite having the lowest number of units sold (0.07M), the in-store method yielded the highest average revenue per unit, indicating a higher price point or more premium product mix.  
• The Outlet channel followed with $2.60M in revenue and 0.08M units sold, reflecting balanced performance. This channel appears to offer steady volume and value without leaning heavily on discounting or premium pricing.  
• Online sales, though slightly behind at $2.47M, recorded the highest volume of units sold (0.09M). This suggests that while online sales are volume-driven, they are likely lower-margin compared to in-store purchases.  

### Revenue Efficiency  
By comparing total sales with units sold:  
• The In-store channel is the most revenue-efficient, with each unit sold contributing significantly more to total sales than other methods. This underscores the importance of maintaining and enhancing the in-store experience to drive high-value purchases.  
• The Online channel shows the lowest average revenue per unit, highlighting potential overreliance on volume-based strategies, discounts, or entry-level product lines. However, its reach and growth potential remain strong.  
• The Outlet channel serves as a middle ground, providing a mix of value and scale.

## 10. Sales Performance Insights by State
![](IMA/Screenshot%202025-05-15%20130052.png)
1. New York ($642K) leads all states in total sales, followed by: California ($601K), Florida ($590K). These three states alone account for a significant proportion of overall sales, highlighting their strategic importance.  
2. High Sales Contributors (Second Tier) States such as Texas ($463K), Washington ($263K), and South Carolina ($292K) form the next tier. Though not as dominant as the top three, they contribute substantially and warrant attention in marketing and sales efforts.  
3. Mid-Level Performers States including Louisiana, Virginia, Oregon, and Nevada generate between $208K and $237K in sales. These states represent stable markets with moderate sales potential.  
4. Low Performing States A number of states, including Nebraska ($60K), Minnesota ($73K), and Iowa ($74K), record the lowest total sales. This suggests potential under-penetration or market challenges that may need strategic review or targeted intervention.

## Conclusions

1. Exceptional Revenue and Volume Growth: Between 2020 and 2021, total revenue increased by 274% and unit sales surged by 326%, highlighting robust market expansion. However, the faster growth in volume than in revenue indicates a strategy centered on market penetration through higher sales volume rather than price increases.  
2. Strongest Product Category: Men’s Street Footwear: This category remained the top performer across both years in revenue and units sold, particularly dominant in the Northeast and West regions, emphasizing broad appeal and high demand.  
3. Women’s Products Lag Behind in Performance: Across both years, men’s products consistently outperformed women’s in terms of revenue and volume. Women’s Athletic Footwear, in particular, remains the lowest-performing category, signaling a need for renewed strategy and positioning.  
4. Sales Channel Dynamics Reveal Mixed Efficiency:  
• In-store: Highest revenue channel with the fewest units sold—indicating premium pricing or higher-ticket products.  
• Online: Highest in units sold but lowest in revenue per unit, suggesting a focus on volume or discount sales.  
• Outlet: Balanced in both metrics, offering a mix of value and accessibility.  
5. Geographic Sales Concentration:  
• Top states: New York, California, and Florida drive the largest share of total sales, representing strategic strongholds.  
• Underperforming states: Nebraska, Minnesota, and Iowa show low market engagement, requiring targeted strategies to boost sales.  
6. Price and Revenue Correlation is Weak: No clear linear trend exists between product price and revenue, implying low price elasticity—consumers continue purchasing at higher prices, especially in men’s categories.  
7. Post-Pandemic Recovery Reflected in 2021: Compared to the volatility of 2020, sales in 2021 demonstrated more stability, higher peaks, and stronger year-end momentum, reflecting improved consumer confidence and market recovery.
